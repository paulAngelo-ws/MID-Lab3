                <p>RWBY is set in the world of Remnant, a future-fantasy world with airships, high-tech weaponry and a form of natural energy called Dust, existing side by side. 
                    According to the narration in the series, the early history of Remnant has been long forgotten, with recollections being passed down in the form of myths and legends.</p>
                
                <p>In the world of Remnant, all living creatures possess a soul, the physical manifestation of which is known as Aura: a form of innate energy that bestows its user with certain abilities and powers. 
                    Semblances are expressions of this power and are akin to a personal superpower unique to each character. Remnant is populated by two intelligent species - Humanity and the Faunus, a species of Human-animal hybrids.</p>
        
                <p>All of the inhabitants of Remnant are beset by the Grimm, which are described as "creatures of destruction" and lack a soul. Huntsmen and Huntresses fight the Grimm and protect the peace of Remnant and its people. 
                    However, not all Huntsmen and Huntresses are good people with many usually only doing it for their own gain.</p>
